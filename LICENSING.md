# Licensing

GM Assistant is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later** (AGPL-3.0-or-later). See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for the full license text.

## Self-Hosted (Free)

The self-hosted version of GM Assistant is **free and fully featured**. You can download, run, and modify the software for your own use under the terms of the AGPL-3.0.

## Hosted SaaS (Paid)

A managed, hosted version of GM Assistant is available as a paid offering. This provides a hassle-free experience without the need to manage your own infrastructure.

## Why AGPL-3.0?

The AGPL-3.0 license was chosen to ensure that the open-source community benefits from any improvements made to GM Assistant. Specifically, the AGPL-3.0 requires that anyone who modifies and deploys this software as a network service must make their modified source code available to users of that service.

This protects against competitors hosting the code as a competing SaaS product without contributing their changes back to the community, while keeping the self-hosted version completely free and fully featured for everyone.

This licensing approach is consistent with other tools in our stack, such as [MinIO](https://min.io/), which also uses AGPL-3.0.
